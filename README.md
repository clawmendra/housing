PetFinder API Data Collection and Analysis
This notebook collects and processes data on adoptable animals using the PetFinder API, focusing on data relevant for analysis, such as breed, age, and compatibility attributes. The data is fetched in multiple pages, covering a wide geographic area with flexible search criteria.

Project Overview
The notebook performs the following tasks:

API Authentication: Uses requests to authenticate with the PetFinder API by obtaining an access token with client credentials.
Data Collection:
Queries the PetFinder APIâ€™s animals endpoint with parameters such as location and search radius to fetch information on adoptable pets.
Data is retrieved in pages, with a maximum of 8 pages to cover a wide range of animals.
Extracts key information for each animal, including attributes like species, breed, age, color, temperament, and compatibility with other pets and children.
Data Transformation:
Organizes the data into a Pandas DataFrame, ensuring fields are consistent and well-formatted for analysis.
Data Analysis:
Prepares the data for visualization and analysis (note: no specific analysis or visualization steps appear in the first cells).
Columns Selected for Analysis
The following columns are kept in the DataFrame for analysis:

organization_id
id
species
name
age
breed
mixed (breed mix status)
color
fixed (spayed/neutered status)
house_trained
good_with_children
good_with_dogs
good_with_cats
gender
distance (from search location)
url (link to the PetFinder page)
Usage
To run this notebook:

Obtain a PetFinder API key and secret from PetFinder Developer Portal.
Insert the API credentials in the client_id and client_secret fields in the notebook.
Execute the cells to authenticate, collect, and view data on adoptable animals within the specified parameters.
Requirements
Python 3.x
requests
pandas
matplotlib (if analysis is extended to include visualizations)
Future Improvements
Enhanced Visualization: Plot distributions of various animal attributes (e.g., age, distance).
Data Filtering: Add filters based on user needs, such as age or compatibility with other pets.
API Pagination Handling: Improve pagination to handle larger data pulls without manual page limits.
